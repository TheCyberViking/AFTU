Versions History
================


* Version 1.43:
  o Removed the command-line options that export the passwords to a
    file from the official version. A version of this tool with full
    command-line support will be posted on separated Web page.

* Version 1.42:
  o Added 'Mark Odd/Even Rows' option, under the View menu. When it's
    turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to
    make it easier to read a single line.

* Version 1.41:
  o Added 'Copy Password' option (Ctrl+P).

* Version 1.40:
  o Added an option to export the passwords into KeePass csv file (In
    'Save Selected Items'). You can use the created csv file to easily
    import your messenger passwords into KeePass password manager.
  o Added 'Add Header Line To CSV/Tab-Delimited File' option. When
    this option is turned on, the column names are added as the first
    line when you export to csv or tab-delimited file.
  o You can now send the email passwords list to stdout by specifying
    an empty filename ("") in the command-line of all save parameters.
    For example: mspass.exe /stab "" >> c:\temp\passwords.txt

Installing MessenPass
=====================

MessenPass can be used without any installation process, simply by
running the executable file (mspass.exe) from the zip file.
If you want to install MessenPass with automatic creation of program
group icons and uninstall support, download and run the self-install
executable file.



Using MessenPass
================

When you run MessenPass, it automatically detects the Instant Messenger
applications installed on your computer, decrypts the passwords they
store, and displays all user name/password pairs that it found in the
main window of MessenPass. If from some reason, MessenPass fails to
locate the installed Instant Messenger application, you can try to
manually select the right folder of your IM application by using 'Select
Folders' option (from the File menu).

On the main window of MessenPass, you can select one or more password
items, and then copy them to the clipboard in tab-delimited format (you
can paste this format into Excel or Open-Office Spreadsheet), or save
them into text/html files.



Command-Line Options
====================

You can also save the passwords of your Instant Messenger applications
without displaying any user interface, by using the following
command-line options:

/stext <Filename>
Save all instant messenger passwords into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save all instant messenger passwords into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma <Filename>
Save all instant messenger passwords into a comma-delimited text file.

/stabular <Filename>
Save all instant messenger passwords into a tabular text file.

/shtml <Filename>
Save all instant messenger passwords into HTML file.

/sverhtml <Filename>
Save all instant messenger passwords into HTML file. (vertical)

/sxml <Filename>
Save all instant messenger passwords into XML file.

/skeepass <Filename>
Save all instant messenger passwords into KeePass csv file.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Software" and "Protocol". You can specify the '~' prefix character
(e.g: "~User") if you want to sort in descending order. You can put
multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by multiple
columns.

Examples:
mspass.exe /shtml "f:\temp\mspass.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
mspass.exe /shtml "f:\temp\mspass.html" /sort "Protocol" /sort "User"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.



Translating MessenPass to other languages
=========================================

MessenPass allows you to easily translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and
other strings to other languages.
In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
1. Run MessenPass with /savelangfile parameter:
   mspass.exe /savelangfile
   A file named mspass_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   MessenPass utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and string entries to the
   desired language.
4. After you finish the translation, Run MessenPass, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run MessenPass without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
